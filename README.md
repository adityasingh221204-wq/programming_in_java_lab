# Programming Logic with Java Lab

This repository contains the laboratory assignments and projects completed for the **Programming Logic with Java Lab** course at **Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune**. The course focuses on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts to build modular, reusable, and scalable software solutions.

---

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
The primary goals of these lab sessions are:
* **Applying OOP concepts** for modular software design.
* **Designing real-life solutions** using inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
* **Developing hands-on skills** in exception handling and generic coding.
* **Managing data** through File I/O and Database Connectivity (JDBC).
* **Building applications**, including console-based and JavaFX applications.
